\section{Sensor analysis}
An overview of the applied sensors is provided in REFERNECE. For each sensor the histogram and the global time series is provided in this chapter.

\subsection{Sensor overview}

Investigated sensors are tabulated below:

\subsection{Sensor directional analysis}
Relevant directional sensor evaluations are shown below.

\subsubsection{Wind - Wave Misalignment}

The occurrence probability of the wind direction and wave direction is considered for normal sea state condition. The misalignment of wind and wave direction, based on the wind direction, is illustrated below.

For the assignment of probabilities to the load situations in the design load case table, the data set is evaluated for each wind speed bin (delta = 1 m/s), wind direction and wave direction, both with a sector width of 30Â° (see Appendix).
