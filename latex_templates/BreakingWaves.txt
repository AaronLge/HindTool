\subsection{Breaking waves}
In accordance to \cite{DNV_RP_C205}, wave breaking (or wave slamming) as a consequence of steep irregular sea states shall be considered in the design of offshore substructures. As criteria, the exceedance of 0.04 by the ratio of significant wave height $H_{s}$ and wave length $\lambda$ is given.

\begin{align}
H_{S} / L\left(T_{p}\right)>0.04
\end{align}

The wave length $L$ is given by the linear dispersion relationship based on the peak period $T_{p}$ of the sea state. The results can be found in Figure \ref{fig:WaveBreak_wind_page_3}, \ref{fig:WaveBreak_wind_page_1} and \ref{fig:WaveBreak_wind_page_2}.\\
