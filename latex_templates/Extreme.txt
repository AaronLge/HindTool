\subsection{Extreme conditions}

The extreme values for the respective occurrence periods are analysed using the Extreme Value Theory developed by Gumbel \cite{Gumb58}. Therefore, the extreme values $x$ are determined by choosing the $n$ maxima per year of the dataset (here, $n=1$ ). The segmentation must not be strictly at the change of the year but can be shifted by a relative offset ("Window offset") to isolate seasonal periods with increased density of extreme values (see Figure \ref{fig:Extreme_Timeseries_Example}). This ensures that any two extreme values aren't correlated with each other.\\

The Gumbel distribution considering is applied to the data set $x$ as follows:


\begin{align}
\label{eq:gumbel}
P_{G u m b}=\exp \left(-\exp \left(-\frac{x-\mu} {\beta}\right)\right) \\
\text{with: }
&\beta=\sigma \frac{\sqrt{6}}{\pi} \quad \text{(scale parameter)}\\
&\mu=\bar{x}-\gamma \beta \quad \text{(location parameter)}
\end{align}


where the standard deviation is denoted as $\sigma$, the mean value as $\bar{x}$ and the Euler-Mascheroni constant $\gamma \approx 0.5772$ . The theoretical probability $P_{th}$ is calculated as the quantile of each of the $N$ (sorted) datapoints, following the Gumbel distribution, by using the formula:

\begin{align}
    P_{t h}=\frac{n-0.5}{N}, n=1 \ldots N
\end{align}

by finding the inverse of Equation \ref{eq:gumbel}.

\begin{align}
    \label{eq:gumbel_inv}
    x_{t h}=-\beta \ln \left(-\ln P_{t h}\right)+\mu
\end{align}


Here, $n$ theoretical extreme values $x_{th}$ are found and compared to the real extreme values $x$.

By visually evaluating the distance from a perfect correlation (Figure \ref{fig:Extreme_qq_example}), shown as the line $x=x_{t h}$, the fit of the distribution can be evaluated. Also shown are the percentiles of the Gumbel distribution. These are numerically determined in the now described method, from now on called "intervall algorithm 1". 
\\Here, $N$ uniformly distributed probabilities $p_{n} \in[0,1], n=1 \ldots N$ are generated and the corresponding theoretical extreme values are found using equation \ref{eq:gumbel}. This is repeated many times ($N_{rep}$) and each of the resulting sets of size $N$ are sorted by magnitude. Now for each magnitude rank with size $N_{rep}$ any percentile can be calculated and is associated with the theoretical extreme values $x_{th}$.

For finding the return periods $T_{R}$ corresponding to the probability value $P$ or vice versa, the formulas below can be applied (see \cite{DNV-ST_0437}).

\begin{align}
\label{eq:P_to_TR}
   P=\left(1-\frac{1}{n T_{R}}\right) \quad T_{R}=\frac{1}{(1-P) n}
\end{align}


Starting from a return period, Eq. \ref{eq:P_to_TR} can be used to the probability $P$. From there, the inverse Gumbel distribution (Eq. \ref{eq:gumbel_inv}) can be used to determine the expected extreme value. Therefore, a logarithmic grid of return periods in the required range $T_{R, j}, j=1 \ldots M$ is created and the corresponding theoretical extreme values $x_{j, m i d}$ are determined.

For finding the confidence intervals, another numerical method is applied ("intervall algorithm 2"). For each of the $i$ determined sets $p_{n}$, new Gumbel coefficients $\beta_{i}$ and $\sigma_{i}$ are calculated. For each of the return periods $T_{R, j}$, the corresponding probabilities $P_{j}$ of the current Gumbel distribution are found. The result is a $N_{r e p}$ by $M$ matrix, in which there are a big number ( $N_{r e p}$ ) of extreme values corresponding to the return periods $T_{R, j}$ on the logarithmic grid. Those can be used to determine the standard deviation $\sigma_{j}$ (intevall mode: "standard deviation") or the percentiles (intevall mode: "percentile") for each of the $j$ return periods $T_{R, j}$. In case of the standard deviation intervall mode, as suggested in \cite{DNV-ST_0437}, these values can be simply added or subtracted to the appropriate value $x_{j, m i d}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{upper bound:\qquad}  x_{j,+\sigma}=x_{j, \text{mid}}+\sigma_{j} \\
\text{lower bound:\qquad} x_{j,-\sigma}=x_{j, \text{mid}}-\sigma_{j}
\end{aligned}
$$

Furthermore, the expected magnitudes and confidence intervals for any needed return periods can be determined by interpolating the found correlations (see Figure \ref{fig:Extreme_TReturn_example}).\\
