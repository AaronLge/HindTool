\section{General theory and definitions}

\subsection{Coordinate systems and directionalities}

The following conventions for coordinate systems directionalities are defined:

\begin{itemize}
    \item All directions stated are relative to the ``Grid North''            direction \rightarrow  NORTH = 0{\textdegree}.
    \item Positive clockwise rotation \rightarrow  EAST = +90{\textdegree}.
    \item Wind and wave directions are always defined as ``coming      from''. \\ 
        Example: 0{\textdegree} wave direction \rightarrow waves are coming from North, going towards South.
    \item Current directions are always defined as ``going towards''. \\
    Example: 0{\textdegree} current direction \rightarrow current is coming from South, going towards North.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Units}
Unless stated otherwise, units are expressed using the SI convention. Sensor units are consistently described in this
document. 

\subsection{Relevant oceanographic design conditions}
An overview of the requirements for the oceanographic conditions in the design of offshore substructures, according to
the load case descriptions in \cite{DNV-ST_0437} and/or \cite{IEC_61400_3_1}, is provided below. It is distinguished between normal conditions and
extreme conditions.

\subsubsection{Normal oceanographic conditions}
The below normal conditions are relevant:

\begin{itemize}
	\item long-term~distribution~of~water~levels (normal water level range)
	\item long-term~distribution~of~currents (normal current model)
	\item long-term~omni-directional~and~directional~distribution~of~1-hourly significant wave height and associated
	peak~wave~period, condensed to wind speed bins
	\item occurrence probability of wind- and wave direction (wind-wave misalignment)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Extreme oceanographic conditions}
The below extreme conditions are relevant:

\begin{itemize}
	\item storm~surge,~50-year, 10-year~and~5-year~return~period (highest and lowest still~water~level)
	\item current~speed,~50-year, 10-year~and~5-year~return~period
	\item 1-hourly~significant~wave~height,~50-year, 10-year~and~5-year~return~period (extreme sea state)
	\item 1-hourly~maximum~individual~wave~height,~50-year, 10-year~and~5-year~return~period
	\item 1-hourly~maximum~crest~elevation,~50-year, 10year~and~5-year~return~period
	\item breaking~wave~probability
	\item 1-hourly~significant~wave~height and associated period for resonant sea state conditions 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sea state and wave spectrum information}
Derivations of sea state parameter for normal conditions can be performed for: 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{wind sea: }wind waves locally generate a set of random surface waves that differ in height, duration and
shape.
\item \textbf{swell sea: }waves which are generated by a distant weather, where the wind blows for a longer duration
over a fetch (distance where the sea can develop without obstacles). Swell waves typically contain long period wave
energy.
\item \textbf{total sea:} no differentiation between wind sea and wave sea
\end{itemize}
Wind and swell sea states are considered as independent of each other. The water-surface elevations of both sea states
are superposed.\\

Where a wave spectrum will be considerd for normal and extreme conditinos (\ac{ESS}, \ac{NSS}, \ac{SSS}), the irregular sea states are
described according to the JONSWAP spectrum definitions in \cite{DNV-ST_0437}:


\begin{equation}
S_{J S}(f)=0.3125 \cdot H_s^2 \cdot T_p \cdot\left(\frac{f}{f_p}\right)^{-5} \cdot \exp \left(-1.25 \cdot\left(\frac{f}{f_p}\right)^{-4}\right) \cdot(1-0.287 \cdot \ln \gamma) \cdot \gamma^{\exp \left(-0.5 \cdot\left(\frac{f-f_p}{\sigma \cdot f_p}\right)^2\right)}
\end{equation}

with significant wave height $H_s$, peak period $T_p$ , peak frequency $f_p=\frac{1}{T_p}$. The peak-enhancement factor $\gamma$ and spectral width parameter $\sigma$ is applied according to \cite{DNV-ST_0437}.  


$\sigma$ is defined as $\sigma = 0.07$ for $f < f_p$ and $\sigma = 0.09$ for $f > f_p$.
