\section{Introduction}
\subsection{General}
For the support structure design of an offshore wind farm, the interpretation of the metocean data is required.
Hydrodynamic load analysis will be conducted on this basis, which basically follow the recommendations in ???  .

\subsection{Document purpose}
This document describes the marine assessment of metocean hindcast data to determine the hydrodynamic load impact in an
offshore wind project. The evaluated design parameter shall fulfil the requirements for a preliminary design phase of
substructure and foundation.
